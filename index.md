# Biography

My name is **Drew Laird**. I'm currently a senior at William & Mary studying **Computational and Applied Mathematics and Statistics**. In my coursework, I've delved into both the theory of statistics, linear algebra, and probability up to the master's level as well as the applications of this theory. My major has exposed me not just to one field of study, but has familarized me with data science, econometrics, and computer science. My coursework has included classes such as **probability**, **statistics**, **econometrics**, **algorithms**, **statistical learning**, **linear algebra**, and **data structures**. This has exposed me to using **Python**, **R**, and **Stata** in a variety of contexts with the capacity to understand the theory of how it works. 

I'm deeply interested in applying data-driven models and insights to untraditional and challenging problems. On top of practicing on Kaggle datasets, I'm also exploring an unsupervised model for biological and training data I've collected on myself in one of my main passions: **cycling**. Check out or follow my [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/35706624) to see the data and my progress! (When I'm not injured) You can find me biking hundreds of miles a week around the Williamsburg area, competing for Tribe Cycling, and leading inclusive bike initiatives on my campus as the student leader for The Bike Alliance. Two of my crowning achievements was raising **$7,545** dollars for a **186-mile charity ride** for cancer called the [Pan-Mass Challenge](https://profile.pmc.org/DL0332) and placing in **second in my school's home race** in a field of 60+ riders. 

My other interests include **film photography**, where I cut and scan it myself. If you see me, I probably have one of my cameras on me. Feel free to check out some of my favorite photos!

This article goes through my history of cycling and how it grew into a passion. I primarily used this article to help raise awareness for my fundraising event--The Pan-Mass Challenge. This article was super important for establishing my own legitamacy and really making the $6,000 goal seem possible.
