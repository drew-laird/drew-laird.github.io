# Biography

My name is **Drew Laird**. I'm currently a senior at William & Mary studying **Computational and Applied Mathematics and Statistics**. In my coursework, I've delved into both the theory of statistics, linear algebra, and probability up to the master's level as well as the applications of this theory. My major has exposed me not just to one field of study, but has familarized me with data science, econometrics, and computer science. My coursework has included classes such as **probability**, **statistics**, **econometrics**, **algorithms**, **statistical learning**, **linear algebra**, and **data structures**. This has exposed me to using **Python**, **R**, and **Stata** in a variety of contexts with the capacity to understand the theory of how it works. 

I'm deeply interested in applying data-driven models and insights to untraditional and challenging problems. On top of practicing on Kaggle datasets, I'm also exploring an unsupervised model for biological and training data I've collected on myself in one of my main passions: **cycling**. Check out or follow my [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/35706624) to see the data and my progress! (When I'm not injured) You can find me biking hundreds of miles a week around the Williamsburg area, competing for Tribe Cycling, and leading inclusive bike initiatives on my campus as the student leader for The Bike Alliance. Two of my crowning achievements was raising **$7,545** dollars for a **186-mile charity ride** for cancer called the [Pan-Mass Challenge](https://profile.pmc.org/DL0332) and placing in **second in my school's home race** in a field of 60+ riders. 

My other interests include film photography, where I cut and scan it myself. If you see me, I probably have one of my cameras on me. Feel free to check out some of my favorite photos!

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
