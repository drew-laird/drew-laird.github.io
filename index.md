# Biography

## Drew Laird

I’m **Drew Laird**, an **AI Engineer at Snorkel AI** in Washington, DC, where I build **synthetic data generation pipelines** and **evaluation frameworks** that help language models learn expert-level skills. My work includes designing agentic system architectures, writing generation blueprints and rubrics, and creating scalable evaluators to validate data quality—including **LLM-as-a-judge** style evaluators deployed in production. I have experience collaborating with most frontier labs, commercial clients, and federal / DOW sponsors.

Before Snorkel, I was a **Machine Learning Engineer at MITRE**, where I led applied research at the intersection of human behavior and machine learning—most notably an effort focused on using LLMs as *human proxies* to study behavioral change in response to media influence. I also served as lead data scientist and technical point of contact on a real-time natural disaster risk analysis platform, working with geospatial and sensor/satellite data and building predictive models for dam incident risk.

I’m a proud graduate of **William & Mary**, where I earned a B.S. in **Computational and Applied Mathematics and Statistics (CAMS)** and built a strong foundation in statistics, probability, linear algebra, algorithms, and statistical learning.

I’m deeply interested in applying data-driven models to *untraditional, messy, high-ambiguity problems*. Outside of work, I’ve explored modeling my own **cycling** training and physiology—producing research on training distribution and fitness dynamics using self-recorded biometric and performance data. You can follow my riding (when I’m not injured) on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/35706624). I also love **film photography** (I cut and scan it myself), and I’m usually carrying a camera.

Some personal highlights I’m proud of: raising **$7,545** for the **186-mile Pan-Mass Challenge** charity ride for cancer and placing **2nd** in my school’s home race in a field of 60+ riders.

This article goes through my history of cycling and how it grew into a passion. I primarily used this article to help raise awareness for my fundraising event--The Pan-Mass Challenge. This article was super important for establishing my own legitamacy and really making the $6,000 goal seem possible.
