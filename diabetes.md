# Diabetes Classification Project

## Write-up in progress...

This project was based off of a diabetes dataset found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathchi/diabetes-data-set?datasetId=818300&sortBy=voteCount)

Download for my [RStudio Notebook File](/diabetes/Diabetes.Rmd).
View the [diabetes data](/diabetes/diabetes.csv).

The code is annotated thoroughly with comments. I go through data cleaning, some feature engineering, and implement the following classification models:
*   logistic
*   KNN
*   random forest
*   SVM (with the RBF kernel)
