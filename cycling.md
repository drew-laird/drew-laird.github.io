## Summary

Between December 28th, 2022 to March 5th, 2023, I trained regularly for the collegiate cycling season. Unfortunately, I broke my hand during one of my races and have been mostly unable to exercise for the last month and a half. In the meantime, I've investigated the quality of my training. I have never had a coach, but, due to my combined obsessions with speed, data, and research, I've learned a lot about training philosophies in my free time. If you've ever sat in the car with me on a long drive, you'll have heard a lot of cycling training podcasts. 

If you want a *semi*-brief, but more specific rundown of cycling training philosophy, [check out another paper I wrote on the topic](/cycling/background.pdf). 

General traning philosophy for endurance training revolves around finding what intensities (measured with perceived exertion, heart rate, and/or power) lead to optimal results. Most athletes will do more low-intensity work in the off-season and increase intensity as the season progresses. However, the specific distributions of these intensities varies according to what training philosophy someone subscribes to. Additionally, training philosophy depends on both the body of the athlete and the time constraints of the athlete. 

The ultimate goal of my research is to find an empirical method of comparision (to myself and others). Only with a numerical "score", could you ever really evaluate whether or not what you were doing was working in the short-term. Additionally, this tool could be useful for athletes in a fitness plateau trying to find what exercises would take them to the next level as fast as possible.

Eventually, if I develop a fitness score that's better than just an athlete's or coach's educated guess, you could take steps to optimize this score. Similar principles could later be applied to other endurance exercises, or even other sports if they had the same quanitty and quality of data.
